// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintenance


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

let analysisOfrequirements = "This is the second step in the cycle as it helps to know the scope of the software development project and ensures the final product that meets the the requirements of the stakeholders."

let Design = "This the third step in the phase to create a detailed plan that meets the needs and is technically feasible and maintainable."

let Implementation = "This the fourth step in the cycle, it involves the development of the software, this phase includes coding, testing, debugging, intergration and deployment."

let testingAndintegration = "This is fifth the step, this phase in the SDLC ensures the quality, reliability and functionality of the software system. "

let Maintenance = "This last step in the phase, it ensures that software system contiues to meet the stakeholderes needs and maintenance typically is an ongoing process that continues the enitre lifespan of the software system."
